Documents: [[roadmap]] (where we stand), [[live-recipe]] (every live test), the design in
`superpowers/specs/2026-11-06-learning-loop-design.md`, the plans under `superpowers/plans/`, [[birdeye]], [[jev]],
[[oktech-features]], [[oktech-settings]]. Live state: the dashboard at `/dash` on the server (phase 1, task 6).

## One database, many writers: every write is a short transaction

Every process on the server writes the same SQLite file (`snipetech.db`, WAL mode): the tape recorder about 100,000
trades an hour, the operator rounds and their jobs (events scan, qualify, the strategy search, the paper test, measure,
book, discover, the strategist). Readers never wait, but only one connection writes at a time, and the recorder waits at
most 20 s for its turn: on 7 Nov a lock held too long, then a refused write left open, stopped the tape for 1 h 45 min
(14:03-15:48), and a paper run that had waited 30 s for the lock died (14:06). So every writer goes through
`Store._write` and commits in short transactions: one row, one trade, one wallet, or a batch of `Store.WRITE_BATCH`
(500) rows, never one transaction across a lab, a network call or a whole table. A write that fails is rolled back at
once (an open transaction keeps the lock and pins the WAL); a refused one is retried for 10 minutes (20 s in the
recorder). The recorder's hourly prune clips the tape's coverage first, then deletes 500 rows per transaction as a task
of its own, the recorder going on in between (measured on a 2.4M-trade copy: another writer waited 2.0 s while one
transaction pruned an hour of tape, 12.4 s for six hours, and 0.08 s at most in batches; the server's database is ten
times larger). Each step of the prune reads at most `Store.PRUNE_SCAN` (5,000) rows, from where the last step stopped,
so a prune reads each old row once, as the single DELETE did. The first batched prune searched again from the oldest row
for every batch: across the trades a list protects, which pile up below the cutoff every day a wallet stays listed, and
through `seen_sigs`, which has no index on ts. Beside 199k protected trades an hour's prune took 43 s of the recorder's
loop, beside 4M 19 minutes in steps of 6 s; now 17 and 27 s in steps of 0.1 s (the single DELETE: 4 and 10 s, the lock
held throughout). Most of what is left is the WAL checkpoints its commits run: 3.3 s instead of 15.8 s with them off,
for an hour with no pile. A reader mid-run sees some of the batches: rows that each stand alone (trades, events,
fingerprints, paper trades, verdicts), so nothing it reads is half made, and during a prune a tape that starts at the
cutoff with some older rows still outside it. A job that dies leaves whole batches, never half of one, and its next run
writes the rest. A new index on a big table, or a table rebuilt, holds the lock for the whole build: run it once by hand
at a quiet hour, never as a line in `SCHEMA` that every process runs when it opens the database.
`tests/test_short_writes.py` guards the rule: a second connection writes while each writer is mid-run.

## Every read of the live file is short; the heavy readers read the hourly copy

A read holds its snapshot of the database until its last row. While it is open, no checkpoint can copy the WAL's newer
pages back into the file, and the WAL cannot start over from its beginning, so the `-wal` file grows with everything
the recorder writes. On 7 Nov the database plus its WAL (`db_gb` in `remote status`) grew about 2 GB an hour from 16:00
to 18:00 (15.1 to 19.3 GB, 11.3 before 14:03) and never shrank. The long reads behind it, measured on a 2.4M-trade copy
of the server's shape (the server holds 11M trades, mostly outside the memory its processes may use): discover's count
of buys by wallet and its hottest coins each walk the whole trades table through one index (14 s and 4 s cold; on the
server discover ran 34-50 minutes with 7-13 minutes of CPU and was killed at its 50-minute limit at 17:57 and 18:57),
the events scan walks it again (4 s, then a read per coin; one scan ran 16:46-17:18), and `paper freeze` ran a whole
lab on the live file (its list of a day's coins alone: 10 s). Those read `snipetech.ro.db` now, the copy `snapshot-db`
writes every hour (`Service.tape_store`, when it is under two hours old; the live file only when there is none): a
tape up to two hours old is fine for wallet discovery, research events and labs, and what they find on it is what they
found on the live file. Their results (candidates, events, frozen strategies) still go to the live file. The readers
that need the newest trades (the book, measure, the live and automatic tests, the paper test, the qualify gates) read
the live file in short reads: one wallet, one coin, or a span in pieces of `Store.READ_SPAN_SECS` (ten minutes; a day
of coins in 144 reads of at most 0.15 s instead of one of 9 s, the same answer), each read whole before the work on it.
`remote sql` and the analyst's `sql` tool stop a query at 30 s. The hourly copy is itself one read of the whole file,
8-10 minutes an hour (18:33:07-18:41:56 on 7 Nov); the backup API pins as long, so it stays. Every connection sets
`journal_size_limit` (64 MiB): once the WAL starts over, the file shrinks back instead of keeping its high-water mark.
`tests/test_short_reads.py` guards the rule: while each reader is mid-run, inside its longest read or between two, a
second connection checkpoints, and every frame must be checkpointed.

Nothing writes the copy once it holds its path. Its readers open it read-only and immutable (SQLite reads the file
alone: no lock, and no `-wal` or `-shm` beside it is ever opened), and a lab takes it only once it holds the lab lock,
so a wait behind another lab never leaves it on a copy that has been replaced since. `snapshot-db` hands each copy over
with the code's whole schema, in rollback mode, and clears what an older job left beside the last one. Until 7 Nov
evening the tape store opened the copy read-write: its schema step put the copy in WAL mode, a deploy's new table went
into a `-wal` under the copy's name, and the next copy renamed over it was read on top of that `-wal` ("database disk
image is malformed" for every heavy reader until the copy after, and on disk too once they had closed). A copy taken
before a deploy that added a table or a column is not read: the live file is, until the next copy.
`tests/test_tape_store.py` and `tests/test_snapshot_db.py` guard it.

## Why a live trip won or lost: the post-mortem's arithmetic is code's

The owner, 7 Nov 22:05: "pnl matters but dont stop the bot" and "just make it understand why it lost and how to do
better". The post-mortem already put each lost trip in one cause and wrote lessons and ideas, but the sums were the
model's, and the tool it read them from added up `fills.pnl_sol`, which keeps a sell's failed duplicate sends apart in
`twin_fee_sol`: over the 58 recorded sells of 5-7 Nov it said -1.0419 SOL and 7 winning trips, where the whole result
was -1.2142 and 5 (9gBmZ4 and the control FqK7tC trip were losses).

`measure/attribution.py` breaks every live round trip (a landed sell and the buys it closed, first in first out as
measure pairs them) into parts that add up exactly to its whole result:
`result = price move - venue fee - buy fees - sell fees - failed duplicate sells`. The price move is the sell's quote
less the buy's on the tape, before any fee; the venue fee is pump.fun's 1.25 % a side (the pool's fee once a coin
trades on PumpSwap), also from the tape; the buy and sell fees are the priority fee, tip and base fee of the two
transactions that landed; the duplicates are measure's `twin_fee_sol`. The whole result has one definition,
`trip_result_sol` (pnl_sol less twin_fee_sol), and every reader of live results uses it: the day stop, the automatic
test's blocks, the post-mortem, `read_fills`, the fee-test report and the strategist's weekly evidence (the last four
summed pnl_sol alone before). measure still stores the two apart. Each trip is marked `won`, `lost_to_costs` (it made
money on the price and the costs took it) or `lost_on_price`; `flips` names the single costs whose removal would have
made it a win; the exit that ran is set against the best exit on the menu in measure's replay, replay to replay.

What each change would have saved on the same trips, and who can make it (`strategist/bounds.py strategist_may_set`:
the strategist only while `[autotune]` is on and its overlay would apply the change):

| change | what it saves on a trip | who |
|---|---|---|
| OKTech sends each exit once (one signed sell, not up to three) | every failed duplicate | OKTech, asked by the owner |
| the sell fee back to 0.001 SOL (`[oktech] sell_fee_sol`) | the landed sell's tip above 0.001 and the same on each duplicate that fee priced | the owner |
| OKTech's minimum bid (0.001 priority + 0.002 tip) | the buy's excess, and its priority again on the landed sell and on tipped duplicates | the strategist for a raised control tip, else the owner |
| one exit on the menu for every copy | nothing it can promise: its replay against the replay of the exit that ran is hindsight, a test and never a saving; a code change, since no setting runs one exit on every copy | the owner |

pump.fun's fee and the price have no lever. The causes are what each part took: each cost in all, and the price on
the trips where it fell, never net of the ones where it rose (the 7 Nov review: over the 58 sells of 5-7 Nov the falls
took 0.9222 SOL and CAT's +0.52 left a net of -0.26, which had put the buys' fees first). The analyst's
`read_round_trips` returns each trip's breakdown and the batch's causes ranked by SOL and changes ranked by what they
would have saved, the exit last and marked `test_only`, with how many copies it differed on; its instructions say to
use those numbers as they are, rank the causes and name the change that would have saved the most. After every turn
that reviewed new live trips, code sends the owner a short summary (`operator/postmortem.py`, called by the round once
the trips are marked reviewed): the trips, the price move before any cost, what the fees and the duplicates cost, the
net, the biggest cause and the change that would have saved the most with who can make it; when the price itself took
the most, the analyst's top idea of the turn comes first, an idea it added before one it only moved. An idea is the
owner's to approve unless it is research the agents run themselves: an idea names no key the code could check
against the strategist's bounds. An exit is named only as "Worth testing", after the savings, and only once it beat the
exit that ran on at least 8 copies where the two differed (`EXIT_MIN_TEST`, the book's own bar before a sniper runs
another exit than lab), better on most of them, in the batch and over every copy measure replayed (`exit_record`).
Telegram, and one line in `operator/notes.md`; no wallet balance, no key, nothing that changes a setting. For the copies
of 7aPo3n of 7 Nov 19:18-19:22: price +0.0294 SOL, pump.fun 0.0152, buys 0.0090, landed sells 0.0090, 4 failed
duplicate sells 0.0080, net -0.0119; OKTech sending each exit once would have saved 0.0080, the sell fee at 0.001
0.0070; hold60 replayed 0.0020 better on one copy of three, so the owner does not hear of it
(`tests/test_measure_attribution.py`, `tests/operator/test_postmortem.py`).

What no trip holds, because no fills row has it (the 7 Nov investigation): the seed-account sweeps of 5-6 Nov (0.0592
SOL, gone since the seed account was turned off), two PumpSwap trips of 6 Nov morning that the tape did not record,
failed buys outside any trip, and the token-account rent each buy parks (0.00151384 SOL) until the owner closes the
accounts in Axiom, which returns 99 % of it.
